# Calcourse_Frontend

Calcourse is a Web Application that a project that generates four-year course plans for us Berkeley students. Every year, new students come in and asking what courses are recommended on discord and reddit. Students taking two or three majors/minors always find it complicated to plan out their courses over the four years. We want to offer this one-stop solution for them.

I am basically in charge of all front-end development. I implemented a animated, responsive design, with an interactive schedule where students can customize the schedule generated by algorithm by just drag-and-drop.

This is the extracted front-end Codebase for Calcourse Website. It is using react framework and the framework codes are not included. Back-end java codes, which are not by me, are excluded as well for conciseness.
